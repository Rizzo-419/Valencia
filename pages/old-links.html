<h2>Planning a Trip to Disney World!</h2>

  <h2 id="resorts">Disney Resorts</h2>
  <!--Rambling text to add length to the page so the anchors will actually scroll down the page.-->
  <p>There are many different resorts to choose from when staying at Disney.  You can choose from Value, Moderate, Deluxe, and Deluxe Villas depending on your budget.</p>
  <p>The value resorts offer the lowest priced options and include the All Stars, Art of Animation, and Pop Century.</p>
  <p>The moderate resorts offer more amenities than the value resorts. Some options here would be the Port Orleans or Caribbean Beach resorts.</p>
  <p>The deluxe resorts kick things up a few notches and offer luxury experience. You can select from the Animal Kingdom Lodge, Beach Club, or Polynesian.</p>
  <p>The deluxe villas allow your entire family and friends to stay together while not having to worry about anything. These are very expensive rooms, but they might be worth it to you. Pick from the Saratoga Springs of the Grand Floridian</p>

  <h2 id="packing">What to Pack</h2>
  <p>You need to protect yourself from the sun so you can bring a few different items including sunscreen, bottles of water, a hat, and maybe even an umbrella. Nobody wants to be that person who is super burnt on their first day and has a horrible time for the rest of the trip.</p>
  <p>Packing some snacks will help cut down on costs. A bag of chips or pretzels can help keep off hunger pains. Your own snacks can help keep your stomach and wallet full for the day.</p>
  <p>A camera is an important thing to remember as well. Since you paid a bunch of money for this vacation you will want to remember it. A cell phone is useful, but a polaroid is the way to go.</p>

  <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
  <h2 id="restaurants">Disney Restaurants</h2>
  <p>You can reserve restaurants ahead of time so you can guarantee yourself a seat. There is a restaurant for every cuisine and budget. There are quick service, sit down, and character dining options.</p>
  <p>For quick service I would recommend checking out the Columbia Harbor House in Magic Kingdom. <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/dining/magic-kingdom/columbia-harbour-house/menus/">Here is a link to their menu</a> on the official Disney website. The combos are well priced and quite delicious.</p>
  <p>As far as sit down restaurants go I would recommend Cape May Cafe. It is a sea food buffet that is sure to impress. If you do not like snow crab I would stay away from this place though.</p>
  <p>Character dining at the Crystal Palace allows you and your guest the opportunity to meet the Winnie the Pooh gang and to take photos with them. This is quite a unique dining experience.</p>
